## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd global-airline-routes-explorer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare dataset**
   - Ensure the `dataset/` directory contains all required `.dat` files from OpenFlights
   - The application expects the following files:
     - `airports.dat`
     - `airlines.dat`
     - `routes.dat`
     - `countries.dat`
     - `planes.dat`

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

### Map View Tab

1. **Select Map Style**: Choose from 8 different map backgrounds using the sidebar selector
2. **Filter by Airline**: Use the dropdown to focus on a specific airline's routes
3. **Filter by Country**: Select a country to view all routes originating from or terminating there
4. **Interactive Map Features**:
   - Hover over routes to see source and destination details
   - Hover over airports to view airport information
   - Zoom and pan for detailed exploration

### Analytics Tab

Explore comprehensive route analytics including:
- **Top 10 Airlines by Routes**: Bar chart showing airlines with the most routes
- **Top 10 Airports by Connections**: Identify the world's most connected cities
- **Most Common Aircraft Types**: Analyze which aircraft dominate specific routes

### Data Explorer Tab

Browse raw data from three datasets:
- **Airports**: View airport names, cities, IATA codes, and coordinates
- **Airlines**: Explore active airline information
- **Routes**: Examine detailed route information including stops and equipment

## Architecture & Technical Details

### Core Technologies

- **Streamlit**: Web framework for rapid development and deployment
- **Polars**: High-performance dataframe library for efficient CSV parsing and data manipulation
- **HoloViews**: High-level plotting API for composable visualizations
- **Bokeh**: Interactive visualization library for web-based graphics
- **hvplot**: High-level interface to Bokeh with Pandas integration
- **Datashader**: Data aggregation and rendering for large datasets
- **Panel**: Framework for building flexible web apps with Python

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Loading**: CSV files are loaded using Polars for efficient memory usage
2. **Type Conversion**: Numeric IDs are safely converted with error handling
3. **Data Merging**: Routes are enriched with airport and airline information through multi-step merges
4. **Coordinate Transformation**: Geographic coordinates are converted to Web Mercator projection for mapping
5. **Caching**: Streamlit's `@st.cache_data` decorator optimizes repeated computations

### Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient CSV Parsing**: Polars provides near-C performance for data loading
- **Lazy Evaluation**: HoloViews and Datashader implement lazy rendering for large datasets
- **Web Mercator Projection**: Fast coordinate transformation for millions of route points
- **Strategic Caching**: Data loading and transformation results are cached to minimize recomputation
- **Viewport-Aware Rendering**: Map visualization automatically adapts to visible region

### Map Styling

The application provides 8 tile providers with carefully chosen color schemes:
- **OpenStreetMap**: Classic detailed street map with blue routes
- **CartoDB Positron (Light)**: Clean minimal light background with blue routes
- **CartoDB Dark Matter**: Sleek dark theme with light blue routes (recommended)
- **Stamen Terrain**: Topographic view with red/orange routes
- **Stamen Toner (B&W)**: High-contrast B&W with orange routes
- **Stamen Toner Background**: Subtle minimal background with red routes
- **Stamen Watercolor**: Artistic watercolor-style with purple routes
- **ESRI Imagery**: Real satellite imagery with yellow/pink routes

- Large datasets may experience performance degradation on older systems
- Satellite imagery tiles require internet connectivity

### Potential Enhancements
- Real-time flight data integration via APIs
- Historical route analysis and trend visualization
- Flight distance and duration calculations
- Aircraft specifications and performance metrics
- Integration with real-time flight tracking APIs
- Route profitability analysis
- Seasonal route variations
- Advanced filtering by aircraft type, stops, or distance

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Error loading data"
**Solution**: Verify that all `.dat` files exist in the `dataset/` directory and are not corrupted.

### Issue: Map not displaying
**Solution**: Clear Streamlit cache with `streamlit cache clear` and refresh the browser.

### Issue: Slow performance with large filters
**Solution**: The application is optimized for modern browsers. Try clearing browser cache or using a different browser.

### Issue: Missing tile provider
**Solution**: Ensure internet connectivity for downloading tile providers from CDN.

## Performance Benchmarks

Typical performance on modern hardware:
- Initial data load: 2-5 seconds (cached thereafter)
- Map rendering: <1 second for full dataset
- Filtered views: <500ms
- Analytics chart generation: <1 second
